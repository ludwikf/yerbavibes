            Information about our users is an important part of our business,

            information to others. We share user information with our parent

            Notice, and as described below.

          <span>
            Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might
            sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user
            information generally is one of the transferred business assets but
            remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
            Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in
            the unlikely event that YerbaVibes.com, Inc. or substantially all of
            its assets are acquired, user information will of course be one of
            the transferred assets.

            Protection of YerbaVibes and Others: We release account and other
            personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
            comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and
            other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of
            YerbaVibes, our users, or others. This includes exchanging

            Third-Party Advertising and Links to Other Websites: YerbaVibes
            Services may include third-party advertising and links to other
            websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect
            information about you when you interact with their content,

            advertising at YerbaVibes, including interest-based ads, please read
            the Amazon Interest-Based Ads policy. To adjust your advertising

          </span>
          <span>
            Use of Third-Party Advertising Services: We provide ad-serving
            companies, ad networks and advertising companies with information
            that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant ads and
            to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other
            information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead,
            we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device
            identifier. For example, we may share a cookie or advertising
            identifier together with a request to deliver an advertisement with
            an ad network to enable you to receive more relevant ads. As an
            additional example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps,
            we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event
            so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some
            ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads
            from other advertisers.

          <span>
            We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in
            connection with collection, storage, and disclosure of personal
            customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may

            It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to

            recommend using a unique password for your YerbaVibes account that

            The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to
            prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other
            identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a
            new cookie, or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies
